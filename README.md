# README

![badge](https://readthedocs.org/projects/42/badge/?version=latest)

Wil this be a forgotten repo in my github? Prolly yes, but I had to try
anyway.

This repo aims to establish a guide for my everyday life decisions,
focused (but not exclusively) in code/computer issues. It aims to reduce
[decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue).

## Usage

I am using sphinx and Read the Docs for this. If locally, you can
build the documentation with:

```txt
# in powershell
.\make.bat html
# in bash
make html
```

## Why 42?

Well, this repo aims to be the [Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42)),
or at least a subset of that. So
is there a better name?
