# Reference Manager

This entry is meant for management of academic references, as scientific
articles or preprints. For the documentation on bookmarks see bookmarks.

If not forced by your institution/supervisor/boss or any external case
you should use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as reference manager.

However, some rules may apply to whatever reference manager software you use.

## Zotero - rules

### Zotfile + google Drive

### Recursive Collections

Recursive collections should be activated. From the
[doc page](https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags#recursive_collections)
they are wrongly set by default. Basically, you won't see a item from your
child folder in your parent folder. This behaviour is annoying.

To set up recursive collections go to:

1. `Editar` > `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Config Editor`
2. type `recursive`
3. Double click to set it to `TRUE`
4. Restart Zotero
