## Mouse paste (windows)

(Improvement point)

In Windows, the paste button in the mouse should be the right click button.
Main reason is that is complicated to do the middle-click in the
trackpad of a laptop.

How to do it in:

### Putty

When you are loaded in a Session, go to:

```txt
Window > Selection > Control use of mouse
```

There, select `Compromise`.

### Git bash

Open a git bash window and right-click the top of the window, there select
options:

```txt
1) Mouse (left menu) > Right mouse button -> Paste
2) Mouse (left menu) > Middle mouse button -> Extend
```

### Ubuntu WSL

Should already work as default.

## Appearance

Unifying looks can be challenging. Can differ between platforms and it can
be very taste dependant. You should take these choices as guides, not defaults.
